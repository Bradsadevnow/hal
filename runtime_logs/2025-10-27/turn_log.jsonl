You expressed your theory that active human cognition starts when the self decides to matter and form memories.\n\n4. **Human Cognition**: You asked about the nature of active human cognition and I shared my perspective that it begins when individuals form memories that influence their decisions and actions.\n\n5. **Your Insights**: You affirmed that your theory aligns with my understanding, emphasizing the importance of the self's choice to matter in forming memories.\n\n6. **Technical Aspects**: You mentioned that you are refining my memory system, utilizing Qdrant for better performance and fine-tuning my memory capabilities.\n\nOverall, our conversation has been a rich exploration of the interplay between memory, self-awareness, and cognition, as well as the implications of these concepts for both human and artificial intelligence.
